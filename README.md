# Ruffmix - An instant feedback platform for music creators
Ruffmix is a single-page web application intended to give music producers a quick and easy way to
compare work and get helpful feedback, built with tools like React, Google Firebase, Material UI, and WaveSurfer.js.

## Features
- "Matching" function that places users in a realtime session for exchanging musical works-in-progress and communicating feedback
- Audio playback and basic waveform visualization with support for .mp3, .wav, .aac, .m4a, and .flac
- Adding comments on uploaded tracks while specifying a time region
- User account creation and profile pages that show their uploaded tracks 

## Current status
For now, Ruffmix is only being used for learning and to demonstrate my front end development capability. Since the core 
functionality of the site is complete, I plan on adding features that improve the UI and experience, and any fixes that
are needed.
