** changed preview track height to full size (96px) using isChild param, does this look right everywhere?
** some unused vars are commented out, ensure everything runs correctly even with these removed
** For configuring rules: 
    - changed uploadtrack to prefix storage w/ uid
    - changed accountview to load from newtrackfile with currentFolder[track].userID + '/audio/'
    - changed Match.js to load matched track from audiofile={matchObj.matchID + '/audio/' + matchObj.folder + '/' + matchObj.track}
        and in creatematchsession: storageRef = firebase.storage().ref().child(this.state.currentUserID + '/audio/' + newFolderID + '/' + newTrackID);
        and in finishreview: audiofile={this.state.currentUserID + '/audio/' + this.state.currentFolderID + '/' + this.state.currentTrackID}

** fixed accountview user tracks section according to privacy settings


/// *PROBLEMS*
- !! Interrupting upload during matching deletes the entire users directory in rtdb !! **occurs when creating new acc while testing matching?
- During matching, comment obj is not aligning to the correct side (commenters on left, author comments on right)

- [OK] on Accountview: a is null error, ensure user is loaded in time before page refresh?
- [OK] Clicking on waveform after clicking timestamp to play region causes toggleplay mismatch
- [OK] Typing New message without having another user selected causes anon convo creation, clicking causes page to crash (disable message input w/out convo?)

- Set timeout routines for all crucial db/storage calls
- On login, User convos section does not populate title of final button (firebase ref problem?)
- After uploading track via matching, then creating new version of track normally, accountview has problems loading audio (unless refresh page)
- AccountView: on componentdidmount(), if a property in userParse doesn't exist, causes crash (apply property check)
- [LATER] Make sure click and drag converts to mm:ss format as well as m:ss *****
- [LATER] BrowseUsers: limit users ref to 9 users so it isn't reading entire users db
- [LATER] Make sure user avatar is used in all locations of <AccountCircle>

/// *IMPROVEMENTS*

    - Comment objects need to show small avatar
    - Click and drag preview regions change the actual timestamp in text field, clear regions removes timestamp 
    - Click and drag automatically un-collapses comments
    - auto scroll messages to the bottom (smoothscroll js function?)
    - Use ButtonGroup component on AccountView Send Message/Add to contacts area
